== Managing Our Work

The TMForum uses a number of online collaboration tools to manage member's work across multiple companies and timezones. This includes weekly meetings, evolution of the API design patterns, API development progress and technical backlogs.

=== Tracking API Asset Production

* Use of JIRA, dashboards, EPICs

=== Technical JIRAs: The API Backlog

* Use of the "Component" attribute
* Reviewed weekly: Only to get consensus on a direction
* Making a report with JQL
* Attaching the technical backlog to the API EPIC?

=== Git Issues: The Tooling and CI/CD Backlog

* Tooling is more code-centric, so more amenable to direct Git references and Git issues
* Reviewed weekly

== The Production Process

Maybe this is just a sumamry table or a flow diagram:

* OAS Specification Generation
* PlantUML Diagram Generation
* Confirmance Profile Generation
* CTK Generation
* RI/Sample Code Generation
* The Publication Process

== How To

=== Creating a CodeSpace

Codespace (https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) is a development environment that is spun-up on request and hosted on your behalf in the Azure cloud by GitHub. This mitigates the technical problems caused by members having different in-house development environments, configurations, language/tool versions, and restrictive corporate firewalls. 

The TMForum pay for this hosting, and boundaries are set on how much RAM and CPU resource is allocated and how long the instance will remain when unattended. The codespace is created from an Ubuntu Linux image that includes popular languages and tools by default.

image::images/part3-codespace.png[Codespaces,1440,1030,align="center",link=https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview,window=_blank]

WARNING: If you create a codespace and work on files locally within it - *and then leave it unattended for more than a few days*, Azure will delete the instance and any local work within it will be lost. Your GitHub registered email address will recieve warning emails from <noreply@github.com> as this deadline approaches.
Always remember to check your work back into your branch before you leave, to avoid any loss.

*To create a Codespace*:

. Having logged into GitHub.com with your TMForum registered identity, navigate to the v5 API repository: https://github.com/tmforum-rand/OAS_Open_API_And_Data_Model

image::images/part3-repo.png[Repository,762,116,align="center",link=https://github.com/tmforum-rand/OAS_Open_API_And_Data_Model,window=_blank]

[start=2]
. The left hand drop-down in the screenshot above indicates your current branch (shown as `v5.0.0-dev`). Click this and select the appropriate branch for your API work.
. Now click the green "*<> Code*" button to the right. This will list any active codespaces that you may have, and allow you to create a new codespace on this current branch, by selecting the "+" button:

image::images/part3-codespace-create.png[Codespace,685,370,align="center",link=https://github.com/tmforum-rand/OAS_Open_API_And_Data_Model,window=_blank]

WARNING: Do make sure you are in the *right repository*, and the *right branch* before doing this - to ensure that GitHub spins up the right configuration for you.

[start=4]
. The codespace will request permissions related to spinning-up the Azure instance. Hit "*Authorize and continue*":

image::images/part3-codespace-authorize.png[Codespace,550,367,align="center",link=https://github.com/codespaces/allow_permissions,window=_blank]

[start=5]
. The codespace will now start up, which may take a minute to produce the initial Microsoft Code IDE within your browser. It will take a further few minutes to run up a docker instance from the terminal window at the bottom. This will finish when the following popup appears in the bottom-right of the browser:

image::images/part3-codespace-app-running.png[Codespace,456,115,align="center",link=https://github.com/codespaces/allow_permissions,window=_blank]

This application presents a simplified menu-driven front-end to the API tooling. Hit "*Open in Browser*" to see this appear in another tab - but you can ignore it for now, we will get back to it later.

If you have ever closed this tab and need to recreate it, click on the *PORTS* tab at the bottom of the main IDE window. Here you should see a single *Port*: 3000 line with column titles of *Forwarded Address*, *Running Process*, *Visibility* and *Origin*. Hover your mouse over the URL under *Forwarded Address* and you should see a small globe icon (highlighted in the circle below):

image::images/part3-codespace-port.png[Codespace,900,108,align="center",link=https://github.com/codespaces/allow_permissions,window=_blank]

If you click on this globe icon, the Web UI tab should be recreated.

*Back in the main IDE tab*: If you use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code IDE (https://code.visualstudio.com/), this will be a familiar layout, but presented through a web browser to an instance running in the Azure cloud, and looking at the TMForum v5 API repository. You can browse and modify files, and changes will be tracked for you to stage and commit from within the IDE back into this Git repository.

This link (https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) describes the basics of using Codespaces, including source control and extensions.

=== Rules File Deep Dive

The TMF API rules file, along with JSON schema files - form the main areas of influence in the construction of a TMF API. Your main activity will be in crafting this rules file together with the associated JSON-Schema files to ensure that the naming and description of entities, properties, operations, notifications and overall structure "hang together" to describe your intensions in agreement with the TMForum API Design Guidelines.

The rules file is a YAML file (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), written in a Domain-Specific Language invented within the TMForum. Its purpose is to describe the high-level structure of the generated OAS file, and it is the main input to the TMF OAS generator.

The high-level structure of a simple rules file is shown below. This describes:

- An API called `MyAPI` (highlighted)
- With a single resource called `MyResource`  (highlighted)
- This resource has four required operations: `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST` and `DELETE`
- The `PATCH` operation does not allow `id`, `href`, `@type`, `@baseType` or `@schemaLocation` to be modified
- The `POST` operation mandates the `name` attribute
- The API can emit 3 notification types: `create`, `change` and `delete`

==== *API Meta Data*
The beginning  of the API rules file - describing the API metadata looks like this:
[source, yaml]
----
rulesVersion: 1.0.0                                         <1>
api:
  name:        MyAPI                                        <2>
  shortName:   MyAPI                                        <3>
  description: MyAPI description                            <4>
  tmfId:       TMFxxx                                       <5>
  hostUrl:     'https://serverRoot/tmf-api/MyAPI/v5/'       <6>
  version:     5.0.0                                        <7>
----
<1> This is the *version of the rules file format itself* - not of the API under construction. It is used by the OAS generator to warn of any outdated syntax, and will change very infrequently
<2> This is the name of your API. It will appear in the OAS file in the `info.title` attribute.
<3> [TODO] shortName
<4> This is the description of your API. It will appear in the OAS file in the `info.description` attribute. Try to keep this description fairly concise, avoid using formatting tags (as the text may appear in many formats: HTML, PDF and OAS rendering). Avoid use of special non-ASCII characters (such as copyright, trademark symbols) as these can also trip-up later parsing.
<5> This is the identity allocated by the TMForum to this API - typically in the form "TMFxxx" - where "xxx" is a three digit number. It has no direct translation into the OAS file, but will be used by the tooling in generation.
<6> The `hostUrl` translates into the `servers.url` attribute of the OAS file. Note that previous TMF-v4 swagger rules files used a `basePath` attribute which is ignored in OAS file generation.
<7> This is the version of your TMForum API. It follows the SemVer (https://semver.org/) versioning format: *<major>.<minor>.<patch>*. This value appears in the OAS file as attribute: `info.version`.

WARNING: New API development is typically started by copying and pasting an existing, working rules file from another API directory. While this is fine, and encouraged - do take the time to go through the above line-by-line to ensure that you have updated the values to reflect your new API.
Old API values are unlikely to throw tooling errors and will need to be caught by human review. If you take this review time up-front, it will prevent problems permeating the OAS file, User Guide and other published artifacts.

==== *API Resources, Operations and Notifications*

The remaining section of the rules file describes the resources of your API and the operations that you are allowing on them. The high-level structure looks like this:
[source, yaml]
----
resources:                                                                          <1>
 - name: ResourceName                                                               <2>
   schema: schemas/Tmf/<Domain>/ResourceName.schema.json#/definitions/ResourceName  <3>
   examples:
    - file: ./documentation/resource-samples/ResourceName.example.json              <4>
   supportedHttpMethods:                                                            <5>
     GET:
       required: true                                                               <6>
     POST:
       required: true
       requiredParameters:                                                          <7>
        - description
       parameterRestrictions:                                                       <8>
        - id
        - href
        - status
    notifications:                                                                  <9>
     - name: create
       schema: schemas/Tmf/<Domain>/Event/ResourceNameCreateEvent.schema.json#/definitions/ResourceNameCreateEvent
----
<1> In the above rules file section, we are describing a single resource (or "endpoint") in our API called `ResourceName`. In reality your API might have a number of resources exposed, in which case everything from (2) onwards would be repeated for each one.
<2> This is the name of our resource being exposed. It will appear in the OAS file under the `paths` property as `/ResourceName`.
<3> Each resource needs to have a single canonical schema, from which all variations are based (see later). This will sit in the `/schemas/Tmf/<Domain>` directory - where `<Domain>` is decided based on how your resources fits within the TMForum Information Model high-level domains (such as *Product*, *Service*, *Resource*, *EngagedParty*, *Common* - etc). This is likely to have been worked out during your API Inception phase by agreement with the TMForum.
<4> Each main resource will have a full example laid out in the User Guide to help provide a context for the API developer who will be using this API.
<5> The `supportedHttpMethods` node provides some combination of the operations that you are allowing on your resource: *GET*, *POST*, *PATCH* and *DELETE*.
<6> For each operation, you can state whether this is required in every implementation of this API. For example, you might decide that a Trouble Ticket API does not make sense without the ability to at least *GET* one or more Trouble Tickets from a ticketing server implementation. In which case, you would state `required: true`. This has no direct translation to the generated OAS file, but the  operation will be mentioned as required in the user guide, and it will cause the TMForum Conformance Test Kit (CTK) to insist that this operation exists and is tested - in order to gain TMForum _conformance_ to this API.
<7> For some operations (POST, PATCH), it can make sense to insist that certain properties are present in the submitted payload from the client. You might decide that an entity MUST at least have a _name_, _description_, _value_ or some combination - for it to make sense. In which case, you would list these properties under `requiredParameters`.
<8> Conversely, you can also insist that certain properties from your canonical resource are *not* submitted by the client with POST-ing a payload. For example it is typically for the producer to decide on properties like *status* or *creationDate*. You would list these under `parameterRestrictions`.
<9> Finally, the API implementation might chose to publish events when significant state transitions occur in its implementation. For example, Orders will typically move through a number of states (such as _acknowledged_, _inProgress_, _failed_, _done_) while processing, and other clients might chose to subscribe an interest in these state changes.

The following operations may suggest these event notifications:
[options=header]
|===
|Operation |Typical Event Notifications
|GET | _none_
|POST | createEvent, statusChangeEvent, 
|PATCH | attributeValueChangeEvent
|DELETE | deleteEvent

|===

NOTE: There are many opportunities to reference example files for the full resource and operation requests and responses. *These are all optional to the generation of the OAS file itself*. While they will be needed for the full publication of the API, its user guide and CTK - we would recommend focussing on the OAS construction and approval before working on the examples, as changes to the structure and schemas of the API will cause a lot of rework to these examples.

==== *JSON-Schema Files*

The API rules file implicitly makes references to a number of JSON-Schema files. Each resource named under the `resources:` section above will cause the OAS generator to search in the schema repository (`OAS_Open_API_And_Data_Model/tree/<YourBranch>/schemas`) for a JSON-Schema file fitting the format: `<MyResource>.schema.json`. In parsing _that_ JSON-Schema file, it will follow any `$ref` references to other JSON-Schema files until it has achieved a transitive-closure of all dependent schemas. This dependency graph will then form the `components.schemas` section of the resultant OAS file, so that all references can be resolved within the API specification.

A cut down TMForum JSON-Schema file for a `Document` entity looks like this:
[source, json]
----
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",                           <1>
    "$id": "Document.schema.json",                                                  <2>
    "title": "Document",                                                            <3>
    "definitions": {
        "Document": {                                                               <4>
            "$id": "#Document",                                                     <5>
            "type": "object",
            "description": "Document is a tangible output from an activity",        <6>
            "properties": {                                                         <7>
                "characteristic": {                                                 <8>
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                        "$ref": "../Common/Characteristic.schema.json#/definitions/Characteristic"
                    }
                },
                "description": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "free-text description of the document"
                },
                "name": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "A string used to give a name to the document"
                }
            },
            "allOf": [                                                              <9>
                {
                    "$ref": "../Common/Entity.schema.json#/definitions/Entity"
                }
            ],
            "required": [                                                           <10>
                "name"
            ]
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This is the version of JSON-Schema grammar that is being followed
<2> This is using the filename of the JSON-Schema file as the unique $id of this schema
<3> This is the JSON-Schema name of the business entity
<4> This is opening a schema definition for this entity
<5> This is using the entity name of the JSON-Schema as the unique $id of this definition
<6> This is the description of this business entity. Try to be concise, and imagine this text appearing as a "tooltip" in an IDE. 
<7> The `properties` node contains the list of attributes and relationships associated with this entity definition.
<8> This `characteristic` is a collection of _things of type Characteristic_, where the _Characteristic_ entity is itself defined in its own JSON-Schema file, being referenced (`$ref`) here. Note that there must be #/definitions anchor to the ref location as in this example : "$ref": "../Common/Characteristic.schema.json#/definitions/Characteristic"
<9> All TMForum "managed entities" will typically include _all of_ the properties of the `Entity` schema. This makes them `Addressable` (so having an `id` and `href`) and Extensible (so having `@type`, `@baseType` and `@schemaLocation`).
<10> The `required` section is an opportunity to list which of the above properties are "required" as a minimum to establish the main entity. In the above example you could say that a Document _is not a Document_ unless it at least has a `name` property.

The JSON-Schema files are all laid out under the `/schemas` directory, where there are sub-directories for each of the domains from the TMForum Information Model ("_SID_"). Do take care when creating new entities to consider the right domain to place your JSON-Schema file.

==== *Generating an OAS file*

* Using the Web UI from when the Cloudspace first spun-up, or if you don't have this available any more, see the end of section 3.1 [TODO: X-Ref]. This tab will present you with a simple Web UI with a drop-down list of APIs, one for every directory under `OAS_Open_API_And_Data_Model/apis`. Use this to find your API in the drop down list:


=== User Guide Deep Dive

* Structure and Template
* Cover Page: Title, Version, Date, Status
* Examples
* Auxillary Diagrams (Lifecycles)

=== Conformance Profile Deep Dive

* Initial Generation
* How to read the file
* How to craft a custom rule

=== Troubleshooting

* Codespace "Express" WebUI
** Stops working
** Generation problems: Looking at the underlying "log.log" file?
** How to run the OAS and user-guide generation without the Express UI?
* Examples are not currently validated against the OAS file

=== Governance Checklists

A table of quick visual tests on the details of the rules file and user guide
As people often start a new rules file with a copy-n-paste from a previous existing file - it is easy for "working errors" to permiate unnoticed.

* API Name: ("Management" convention?)
* API Version: Following SemVer.org
* API Description: Short/Concise: Avoid formatting and non-ASCII characters
* Basepath/Server.URL: Do not use 'basePath' in the rules file - even though it is commonly copy-n-pasted from v4 rules files. It will not reflect in the OAS file.

==== Schema files

* Use of $ref: /definitions
* Attribute descriptions: Be careful in Common/ to be 'generic'

==== Submitting Your API for Review

Please consider the following checklist before submitting your API for review:

* [ ] No errors are shown on the Checklist tab in the Express UI after selecting your API
* [ ] No errors are shown on the Examples tab in the Express UI after selecting your API and choosing to validate examples
* [ ] No errors are shown in the output window of the Express UI when you generate the various assets (OAS file, user guide, conformance profile)
* [ ] No errors are shown at the bottom of your pull request, as a result of running the automatic validations.
* [ ] In your examples, ensure that `<entity>Ref` examples include the correct fields, including `@referredType` populated
* [ ] In your examples for notifications, ensure that you abide by the rules:
  ** [ ] Create event – the payload should show the entire entity
  ** [ ] Attribute change event – the payload should show only the `@` properties, `id`, `href`, and the changed properties (in PATCH Merge format)
  ** [ ] Status change event – the payload should show only the `@` properties, `id`, `href`, and the changed status/state value
  ** [ ] Delete event – the payload should show only the `@` properties, `id`, `href`
* [ ] In your examples for PATCH operation, ensure that you have all four example formats, with both request and response for each example
* [ ] In your examples, ensure that the `id` and `href` are consistent with each other (basically the `id` should be identical to the last part of the `href`, after the rightmost `/` character)
* [ ] If you use the example generation tool, ensure that you have replaced all the placeholder dummy strings and values with realistic values

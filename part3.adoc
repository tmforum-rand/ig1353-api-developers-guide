== Executive Summary

This “How To” document set provides onboarding instructions and a user-guide for the TMForum Open-API development tools. The document is organized in multiple parts as follows:

[options=header]
|===
|Document Part |Summary

|*Part One: Initial Onboarding* |Prerequisites/Good To Know, First-Time Onboarding
|*Part Two: Starting a New API* |API Inception, API Profile, Getting an API Number
|*Part Three: The API Development Loop* |Admin: JIRA issues, Git issues and Branching, API Tools, How To Deep-Dives
|*Part Four: Advanced API Development* |ASyncAPI Specifications, How to make a DCS API, How to make a Composite API
|===


This part (Part Three) of the document provides an overview of the API development process, the inputs expected by the API author and the use of the tools to generate the necessary documents.

== Managing Our Work

The TMForum uses a number of online collaboration tools to manage member's work across multiple companies and timezones. This includes weekly meetings, evolution of the API design patterns, API development progress and technical backlogs.

=== Tracking API Asset Production

* Use of JIRA, dashboards, EPICs

=== Technical JIRAs: The API Backlog

* Use of the "Component" attribute
* Reviewed weekly: Only to get consensus on a direction
* Making a report with JQL
* Attaching the technical backlog to the API EPIC?

=== Git Issues: The Tooling and CI/CD Backlog

* Tooling is more code-centric, so more amenable to direct Git references as Git issues
* Reviewed weekly

== The Production Process

Maybe this is just a sumamry table or a flow diagram:

* OAS Specification Generation
* PlantUML Diagram Generation
* Confirmance Profile Generation
* CTK Generation
* RI/Sample Code Generation
* The Publication Process

== How To

=== Creating a CodeSpace

Codespace (https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) is a development environment that is spun-up on request and hosted on your behalf in the Azure cloud by GitHub. This mitigates the technical problems caused by members having different in-house development environments, configurations, language/tool versions, and restrictive corporate firewalls. 

The TMForum pay for this hosting, and boundaries are set on how much RAM and CPU resource is allocated and how long the instance will remain when unattended. The codespace is created from an Ubuntu Linux image that includes popular languages and tools by default.

WARNING: If you create a codespace and work on files locally within it - *and then leave it unattended for more than a few days*, Azure will delete the instance and any local work within it will be lost. Your GitHub registered email address will recieve warning emails from <noreply@github.com> as this deadline approaches.
Always remember to check your work back into your branch before you leave, to avoid any loss.

*To create a Codespace*:

. Having logged into GitHub.com with your TMForum registered identity, navigate to the v5 API repository: https://github.com/tmforum-rand/OAS_Open_API_And_Data_Model

image::images/part3-repo.png[Repository,400,400,align="center",link=https://github.com/tmforum-rand/OAS_Open_API_And_Data_Model,window=_blank]

[start=2]
. The left hand drop-down in the screenshot above indicates your current branch (shown as _v5.0.0-dev_). Click this and select the appropriate branch for your API work.
. Now click the green "*<> Code*" button to the right. This will list any active codespaces that you may have, and allow you to create a new codespace on this current branch, by selecting the "+" button:

image::images/part3-codespace-create.png[Codespace,400,400,align="center",link=https://github.com/tmforum-rand/OAS_Open_API_And_Data_Model,window=_blank]

WARNING: Do make sure you are in the *right repository*, and the *right branch* before doing this - to ensure that GitHub spins up the right configuration for you.

[start=4]
. The codespace will request permissions related to spinning-up the Azure instance. Hit "*Authorize and continue*":

image::images/part3-codespace-authorize.png[Codespace,400,400,align="center",link=https://github.com/codespaces/allow_permissions,window=_blank]

[start=5]
. The codespace will now start up, which may take a minute to produce the initial Microsoft Code IDE within your browser. It will take a further few minutes to run up a docker instance from the terminal window at the bottom. This will finish when the following popup appears in the bottom-right of the browser:

image::images/part3-codespace-app-running.png[Codespace,400,400,align="center",link=https://github.com/codespaces/allow_permissions,window=_blank]

This application presents a simplified menu-driven front-end to the API tooling. Hit "*Open in Browser*" to see this appear in another tab - but you can ignore it for now, we will get back to it later.

Back in the main IDE tab: If you use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code IDE (https://code.visualstudio.com/), this will be a familiar layout, but presented through a web browser to an instance running in the Azure cloud, based on the TMForum v5 API repository. You can browse and modify files, and changes will be tracked for you to stage and commit from within the IDE.

=== Rules File Deep Dive

* API meta data
* List of Resources

=== User Guide Deep Dive

* Structure and Template
* Cover Page: Title, Version, Date, Status
* Examples
* Auxillary Diagrams (Lifecycles)

=== Conformance Profile Deep Dive

* Initial Generation
* How to read the file
* How to craft a custom rule

=== Troubleshooting

* Codespace "Express" WebUI
** Stops working
** Generation problems: Looking at the underlying "log.log" file?
** How to run the OAS and user-guide generation without the Express UI?
* Examples are not currently validated against the OAS file

=== Governance Checklists

A table of quick visual tests on the details of the rules file and user guide
As people often start a new rules file with a copy-n-paste from a previous existing file - it is easy for "working errors" to permiate unnoticed.

* API Name: ("Management" convention?)
* API Version: Following SemVer.org
* API Description: Short/Concise: Avoid formatting and non-ASCII characters
* Basepath/Server.URL: Do not use 'basePath' in the rules file - even though it is commonly copy-n-pasted from v4 rules files. It will not reflect in the OAS file.

Schema files

* Use of $ref: /definitions
* Attribute descriptions: Be careful in Common/ to be 'generic'


== Administrative Appendix

This Appendix provides additional background material about the TM Forum
and this document. In general, sections may be included or omitted as
desired, however a Document History must always be included.

=== Document History

==== Version History

This section records the changes between this and the previous document
version as it is edited by the team concerned. Note: this is an
incremental number which does not have to match the release number and
used for change control purposes only.

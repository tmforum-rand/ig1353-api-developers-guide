## Visual Assets Needed

## Multilingual Adaptation Notes

### Text Elements to Minimize:
- Slide titles can be kept as visual headers
- Bullet points should be replaced with icons where possible
- Technical terms should be consistent across languages
- Tool names remain in English (GitHub, JIRA, etc.)

### Cultural Considerations:
- Use diverse, inclusive imagery
- Avoid region-specific references
- Consider right-to-left language support
- Include universal symbols and icons

This “How To” document set provides onboarding instructions and a user-guide for the TMForum Open-API development tools. The document is organized in multiple parts as follows:

[options=header]
|===
|Document Part |Summary

|*Part One: Initial Onboarding* |Prerequisites/Good To Know, First-Time Onboarding
|*Part Two: Starting a New API* |API Inception, API Profile, Getting an API Number
|*Part Three: The API Development Loop* |Admin: JIRA issues, Git issues and Branching, API Tools, How To Deep-Dives
|*Part Four: Advanced API Development* |ASyncAPI Specifications, How to make a DCS API, How to make a Composite API

== Prerequisities / Good to Know

The TMForum uses a variaty of collaboration tools to coordinate the requirements and development of APIs:

[options=header,stripes=even]
|===
|Document/Website |What Is It |Further Reading

|Swagger/OAS files |The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a framework used by developers to build applications that interact with REST APIs. The specification defines how to communicate with an API, what information can be requested, and what information can be returned. | HTTP Link
|TMF Forum API Design Guidelines |REST itself is only a paradigm. The TMForum has written down a number of 'positions' taken in the specific design of REST API specifications, such as Entity CRUD operations and Task operations, filtering and attribute selection and many more | HTTP Link
|GitHub and Codespaces |GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code through Version control. | HTTP Link
|Microsoft Visual Studio Code |GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows developers to work on their local development environment on any device and from anywhere. Visual Studio Code is a rich text editor like Sublime Text and Atom. TMForum use a hosted browser-based version of this through Codespaces. | HTTP Link
|editor.swagger.io |The Swagger Editor is an open source editor to design, define and document HTTP-based and event-driven APIs using the OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications, respectively. | https://editor.swagger.io
|JIRA |https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/getting-started/introduction#what-is-jira-software[JIRA] from https://www.atlassian.com/[Atlassian] is used extensively for Project and Issue tracking. | HTTP Link
|Confluence |*Confluence* also from from https://www.atlassian.com/[Atlassian] is used ... | HTTP Link
|PlantUML | https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] is a language and tool used to craft UML diagrams but textual description. Class diagrams are auto-generated in PlantUML, and auxillary diagrams (such as state transition diagrams) can be hand-coded by the author | HTTP Link
|Postman |Postman is a tool that TMForum uses to act as a client, to exercise all mandatory aspects of their API specifications. This is used by vendors and operators to certify that their server-side implmentation meets the minimum necessary conformance to the specification. | HTTP Link

=== TMForum Information Model Basics

As a minimum, a high-level familiarity with the following information model concepts will be essential for your ability to author a TMForum API:

* Products, Services and Resources
* Catalog, Order, Inventory
* Party and PartyRole


== First-Time Onboarding

Before you can begin coding an API, you first need to establish an identity and profile with the TMForum. While API deliverables are largely Apache V2.0 licenced and free, the internal development is made by TMForum members in closed GitHub repositories.

=== Registering on TMForum.org

The first step is to register yourself with https://www.tmforum.org/register. This is a one-time step. If you are a part of an existing TMForum member organization, you will need to use your organization's domain name in the email address that you use to register.

image::images/part1-register.png[Registration,400,400,align="center",link=https://www.tmforum.org/register,window=_blank]

Each member organization has an individual allocated as a single point of contact for TMForum. It is possible that your application to register triggers an email approval to this person, internal to your company. It is worth confirming this with your organization's TMForum account manager to avoid any delay in your registration.

=== Registering on TMForum.org

Once you are registered, it is worth completing your profile by uploading a *Current Picture* (_jpg, gif or png_). This helps others to identify you in Confluence edits and JIRA issues.

=== Joining the API Programme

Having registered and established a profile, you now need to join the API Program. This is also a one-time step. All TMForum projects are laid out here: https://myaccount.tmforum.org/joinproject. Scroll down this list to the *Open APIs* project and hit *JOIN THE PROJECT*:

image::images/part1-join.png[Joining,400,400,align="center",link=https://myaccount.tmforum.org/joinproject,window=_blank]

Once you have joined this button will become red and you can *VIEW PROJECT*:

image::images/part1-viewProject.png[Joining,400,400,align="center",link=https://myaccount.tmforum.org/joinproject,window=_blank]

This will take you to the API Project Home Page within TMForum.org (https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/display/AP/Open+API+Project+Home). This is hosted in TMForum's private Confluence site. This home page wil lay out the people involved (this is where the photos are useful), the workstreams and team calendar (https://projects.tmforum.org/wiki/display/AP/Open+APIs+calendar). By joining the team you should receive calendar invites to each of the API program meetings.

=== Team Meetings

The most up-to-date list of meetings should be available from the above team home page. You are not obliged or expected to attend all of these, but it would be useful to "tune in" to the agendas, priorities and people involved. Some of the main recurring meetings are:
